# AssemblyProject
This is my Assembly language semester project which I made in university. It is guessing game.
 
 In this project or game, user will be given three chances to guess a number from 0-9.
 If it manages to guess right then he or she will get a right guess message.
 In other case that is user failed thrice, then correct guess will be displayed.
 
 After both cases user will be asked if they want to continue, if yes they will continue with the game and in other case program will exit.
 
 Here we have used jumps, procedures, loops and a method to store a random number in bl register.

This project was made on emulator 8086 or EMU8086.
